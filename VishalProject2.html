                <p>
                    Train Your Cat
Cats are smarter than many people think and they have a great memory. Experts state that cats have both long-term and short-term memory so they are trainable. At the same time, it also means they know what they can get away with repeatedly.

Pets, like people, react well to positive reinforcement, so cats will remember when they get something they enjoy. Most cats like attention, food, toys, or all three. Choose a motivator that you can use to entice your cat to do what you want it to do and to provide it with a form of positive reinforcement. If possible, reward your cat with this special item only when training for this particular behavior. By reserving the desirable item for training, it will add to the value of the reward and make it that much more enticing to your cat.

If you are struggling to find an item that your cat is motivated by, consider things like tuna, canned spray cheese, shrimp, and catnip toys.

                <h2>Discourage Bad Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    
Disciplining your cat personally is not a good idea. It does nothing but teach your cat to be afraid of you and does not deter the bad behavior when you are not present. However, there are some ways to prevent behavior even if you aren't around.

Use double-sided tape or aluminum foil: These simple things can be placed on surfaces you don't want your cat on or scratching. Cats do not like the textures.
Use motion activated air-sprays: Place these devices around areas you do not want your cat to access. If the cat comes close it will spray air and typically, deter the cat from coming closer.
Say something: Startle your cat with a loud "ouch" or another word to end any rough behavior. This is effective for cats that are aggressive with people and may bite or grab onto your arm or leg. Then immediately remove yourself from the cat. Go into a room and shut the door. Do not respond with force to a cat that is showing aggression, it increases the aggression in the cat and reinforces that the cat should be wary around you. Do not attempt to pick up a cat that is showing aggression as this will typically increase aggressive behavior. The safest and most effective thing to do is remove yourself for a few minutes and then if your cat is calm when you return reward it. Cats that are aggressive are typically scared or stressed out about something so it is important to try to identify potential issues in a cat that is showing aggression towards people or other animals.

            <h2>Positive Reinforcement</h2> 
Often abbreviated as R+ in training circles, positive reinforcement is when something desirable comes about as a result of a behavior. "Positive" refers to the addition of something and "reward" refers to that addition being desirable, thus reinforcing the behavior. For example, giving a cat praise and treats for coming when called or going to a designated mat or area when asked.
            <br>
            
        <h2> Negative Reinforcement</h2> 
This one can be trickier for some to understand but just remember that "negative" refers to something being taken away and "reinforcement" refers to that reinforcing the behavior. This tactic isn’t utilized as much in pet training but in people, like buckling your seat belt to get the seat belt alarm to stop beeping. The alarm stopping reinforces you buckling your seat belt. So instead of getting something fun like a reward for doing the behavior, the desired outcome is stopping something bothersome, such as the annoying sound of the alarm.
            <br>
            
            <h2>Positive Punishment</h2> 
This principle is a hot topic in pet training. Again, "positive" refers to the addition of something while "punishment" this time refers to it not reinforcing the behavior. In pet training, these punishments are often called aversives and can be a stern voice telling them "No," a tug on a choke chain, or using a shock collar (sometimes called e-collars, electric collars, or correction collars). For cats, this might be a spritz with a water bottle or the sound of tin foil where you don’t want them to be.
            <br>
            
        <h2> Negative Punishment</h2> 
This, similar to the negative reinforcement principle, is one that’s not utilized as much in pet training. "Negative" refers to something being taken away and "punishment" refers to it not reinforcing the behavior. In parenting, this could be taking away a toy or device when your child is misbehaving. With pets, this is sometimes used to discourage behaviors like jumping or biting.
