                <li> A proper dog training program is the cornerstone of good behavior in dogs. It has often been said that there are no bad dogs, only uneducated owners. Most dogs thrive with boundaries and predictable routines. Without obedience training, they simply do not know how to behave. Well-trained dogs are happier and healthier than untrained dogs, and so are their owners.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>There are a lot of different ways to train your dog. You may choose to sign up for a dog training class, hire a professional dog trainer for private lessons, or even send your dog to board with a trainer. However, plenty of people successfully train their dogs on their own. It's a great way to save money on training costs, and a wonderful way to bond with your dog.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>In order to effectively train your dog, it's important that you have a plan. You will need to gather some equipment, set up a schedule, and learn a few things about training. You also need to be fully committed and prepared for a daily commitment. Here's what you need in to begin a dog obedience training program yourself.

                    <p class="p1"> 
                        Effective dog training does not require many items, but there are a few basic supplies that will help make the process more convenient and effective. Choose a dog collar or harness that is suitable and comfortable for your dog. Then decide which dog leash is best for training. A retractable leash is not appropriate for dog training.

                    <p class="p1">
                        Before you begin dog obedience training, choose the best method for you and your dog. Training styles vary, but most trainers agree that dogs respond best to positive reinforcement, such as praise or treats. One common training variation, known as clicker training, includes the use of conditioned reinforcer. There are plenty of dog training books and websites where you can learn about training techniques

                     <h2>-->Set up Sessions</h2>
                    <p class="p1">
                        Success is usually attained in small steps. Training sessions with your dog should last 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times per day. This is especially true for puppies because of their very short attention spans. Longer sessions can cause an adult dog to become bored. Start by teaching basic commands. 
                    </p>  <br> 
                    <h2>-->Basic Commands</h2>
                    <p class="p1">
                        
                        Often, the sit command will be one of the easiest for your dog to learn first. Next, you can train your dog to lie down. At the same time, work on teaching your dog to stay. In addition, your dog should be trained to come when called as soon as possible. This is one of the most important fundamental commands. 
                    </p>  <br>

                        Seeking professional help doesn't mean ditching your DIY training program. You can find a professional dog trainer who offers private training sessions, and some trainers even offer online sessions. Many dog owners prefer to join a local dog obedience class so they will be under the supervision of a dog training instructor without the higher cost of private sessions.
                    </p>  <br>
                    <h2>-->Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2>
                    <p class="p1">
                        
                        Dog training takes time, and you and your dog are likely to hit a few bumps along the way. You may see some resistance or stubborn behavior. Keep things positive and reward your dog for good behavior, and make sure you use a reward your dog will work for.
