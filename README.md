## ADOPTION SECTION: DESIGNED BY PARAM GANDHI

- I made the adoption page. As everyone can comprehend from the page name itself that it is a very imperative and sensitive topic, but still I needed to make it attractive and alluring enough for the best user experience. I added an automatic slider consisting of pets images and over it I added how to find NGO's according the postal codes. Afterwards, I proceeded to add a fun quiz pertaining to pets using JS just for making it exciting. Similarly, I added FAQ section too using JS to give important information about pets. I added some more things too, but this was the excerpt of what I did in this project.


## LEARNING CURVES AND CHALLENGES:

- Gleaning the knowledge about javascript and how to incorporate in the project.
- How to make a quiz using JS.
- How to use CSS with JS.
- Finally, how to make all these things responsive was a big task too.

  √ Leaning curve and challenges
   When I was trying to add div to control the elements as supposed to do, the external div and the internal div always make my page looks very messy. I tried to find    the answer on the W3Schools, also the website to find some pages to parse its code contents, I think this should be the part I need to keep learning, and it might      be the most important part of web design as well.
  √ Description：In my parts I discussed what pet food is in the pages, and it is a brief introduction to pets food. Moreover, the nutritional elements that pets need   in their daily life, as well as the benefits and disadvantages of each; Finally, the pet food companies in the current Canadian market are summarized, along with       some mainstream brands on the market.
